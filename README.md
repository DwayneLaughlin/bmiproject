# bmiproject
Inspired by a recent decision to lose weight I created this. The main functionality is that it can take your weight (in pounds) and your height (in inches ) and calculate your BMI.

Future features: 
-conversion/ability to select metric weight and height measurements
-displaying where result falls on BMI chart
